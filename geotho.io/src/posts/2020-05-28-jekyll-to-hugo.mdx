I've ported my blog from Jekyll to Hugo.

## Why?

1. I couldn't build the old Ruby stack anymore.
2. I like Go, and Hugo is written in Go.

## What changed?

1. Theme changed.
2. Source code of blog lives in [geotho/hugo][hugo].
3. GitHub Actions [builds and commits][workflow] the built blog to [geotho/geotho.github.io][github.io].
4. Switched to $\\KaTeX$ from MathJax.
