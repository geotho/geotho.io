title: "Record 'friction' to build quality software"

When was the last time you were consciously impressed by the quality of
some software?

It might have been a particularly helpful error message — one that explained
what you were doing wrong and how you might fix it.
Or a testing library whose assertions were clear and transparent.
Or a service mesh whose installation worked first time.

Quality in software doesn't appear by accident. It takes a great deal of effort
to make a good developer experience.

One strategy to dramatically and deliberately increase quality is to document
'friction' when people use your software. This can then inform your product roadmap.

Enter: the *friction doc*.

## What is a 'friction doc'? 🤷🏻‍♀️

A friction doc is a durable record of issues that your users encountered while
trying to use your software.

Encourage your users to record difficulties as they encounter them.
Then schedule a follow-up where your user can share their friction doc with you.

Friction docs are to developer experience what code review is to PRs.

Any piece of software can have a friction doc: APIs and SDKs, command line
tools, server infrastructure, even documentation and tutorials.

## Tips for writing friction docs ✍🏼

If you've been asked to write a friction doc,
the following tips might be useful.

### 1. Keep it factual 🔢

Write sentences of the form "When I tried to do X, Y happened instead. I assumed
Z, which turned out to be incorrect." Avoid being emotive
(e.g. "This is disappointing") as it is likely to dilute your issue.

### 2. Do it live 📺

Keep a running doc and record issues as they come up.
Often, you'll encounter some issue, realise it was due to some misunderstanding,
and then disregard it with hindsight bias.
But the point of the friction doc is to record these misunderstandings so they
can be fixed for the next person. So record them as they come up.

### 3. Provide suggestions, not solutions 🔮

The old adage goes "Don't bring me problems; bring me solutions!"

It is helpful to provide suggestions to mitigate the friction
(e.g. "the error message could be more informative if it mentioned X").
But remember:

1. The author of the software may have thought about the problem already;
2. There may be good reasons that what you are suggesting is unworkable
   (see [Chesterton's Fence]).

So when making suggestions for fixes, be mindful that there may be other aspects
of the problem that you haven't yet considered.

### 4. If you've noticed it, it's big enough to include 🐛

Don't feel bad about recording nits, typos or small bugs. If they are minor,
they should be easy to fix. There's a bit of [broken windows theory] here:
how much would you trust software that had misspellings in its outputs?

### 5. Be kind! 😇

Remember that you're providing feedback to help make the software better.

Some specific pointers on being kind:

- **Don't surprise the recipient** — Instead, ask "Hey, I usually make notes
  on the things I found difficult when using new software. Would you mind if I
  shared it with you when I am done?"
- **Share your feedback in person or via VC** — It's easier for comments to be
  misinterpreted when they are read rather than spoken. Your feedback might come
  across harsher than intended if presented only as a document / email.
- **Read your notes back before you send them** — If you must feedback via text,
  read through your notes before sending them on. Check whether any of the
  comments can be intrepreted in a less charitable fashion.
